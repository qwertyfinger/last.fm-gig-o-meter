# Last.fm Gig-o-Meter
Simple application that lets you discover your 'concert compatibility' with your favourite music artists. Download apk <a href="https://github.com/qwertyfinger/last.fm-gig-o-meter/raw/master/last.fm%20gig-o-meter%20v0.1.apk">here</a>.

<b>Future plans:</b> work is going on creating a full-fledged social app for all your concert activities! <em>(ETA: middle-late spring)</em>

<h3>Idea</h3>
The algorithm works by measuring how much artist's songs you listen to match with songs this artist plays at gigs.

The necessary data is available thanks to <a href="http://www.last.fm">Last.fm</a> and <a href="http://www.setlist.fm">Setlist.fm</a> via their APIs.

<h3>Technical side</h3>
Application utilizes MVP architecture, as described <a href="https://github.com/ribot/android-guidelines/blob/master/architecture_guidelines/android_architecture.md">here</a>.

In its work it relies on such great libraries as <a href="https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding/index.html">Data Binding</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava">RxJava</a>, <a href="https://github.com/square/retrofit">Retrofit</a>, <a href="https://github.com/square/sqlbrite">SQLBrite<a>, <a href="https://github.com/square/picasso">Picasso</a>.
